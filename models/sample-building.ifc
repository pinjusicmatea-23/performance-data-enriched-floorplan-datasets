# IFC Model Placeholder

This file represents where you would place your actual IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) model.

## About IFC Files

IFC files contain 3D building information including:
- **Geometry**: 3D shapes and dimensions
- **Materials**: Building material specifications  
- **Structure**: Walls, floors, roofs, windows, doors
- **Properties**: Metadata about building elements
- **Relationships**: How elements connect and relate

## Supported Formats

- `.ifc` - Standard IFC format
- `.ifcxml` - XML-based IFC format

## How to Add Your IFC Model

1. **Export from CAD Software**: Most architectural software (Revit, ArchiCAD, SketchUp, etc.) can export to IFC format
2. **Place in Models Folder**: Copy your `.ifc` file to this `/models/` directory
3. **Update the Viewer**: The website will automatically detect and allow loading of IFC files
4. **Test the Viewer**: Use the 3D viewer to pan, rotate, and zoom through your model

## Viewer Features

- ✅ **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
- ✅ **Rotate**: Right-click and drag to rotate view  
- ✅ **Zoom**: Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- ✅ **Reset View**: Return to default position
- ✅ **Wireframe Mode**: Toggle between solid and wireframe display

## File Size Considerations

- Small models (< 10MB): Load quickly in browser
- Medium models (10-50MB): May take a few seconds to load
- Large models (> 50MB): Consider optimizing or splitting the model

## Browser Compatibility

The IFC viewer works best in:
- Chrome 70+
- Firefox 65+ 
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
